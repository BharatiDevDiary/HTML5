# 📖 Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1️⃣ What is Web and How Does it Work?

The **Web (World Wide Web)** is a system where information is stored on servers and accessed through the internet using browsers.

When you type a URL (like `www.google.com`) in your browser:

1. The request goes to a **server**.
2. The server finds the requested page.
3. The server sends back the page’s code (**HTML, CSS, JS**).
4. The **browser displays** it to you.

👉 The web works on the **client-server model** and mostly uses the **HTTP/HTTPS protocol**.

## 2️⃣ Client Side vs. Server Side

- **Client Side** → What runs in the user’s browser (**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**).

  - Example: When you click a button, JavaScript changes the page color instantly (without contacting the server).

- **Server Side** → What runs on the web server (**Java, PHP, Python, etc.**).
  - Example: When you log in, the server checks your username & password from the database.

👉 **Frontend = Client Side | Backend = Server Side**

**Real world Example :**

Think of it like a restaurant:

Client Side = Menu + Waiter (what you see)

Server Side = Kitchen (where the food is prepared)

## 3️⃣ What is the Function of a Web Browser?

A **Web Browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) is software that:

- Sends requests to web servers.
- Receives code (**HTML, CSS, JS**).
- Translates/renders that code into a **visual webpage** that we see.

👉 Think of it like a **translator** that converts web code into readable content for humans.

## 4️⃣ What are Frameworks?

A **framework** is a pre-built structure or toolkit that helps developers build applications faster, without writing everything from scratch.

✅ It provides ready-made **code, libraries, and rules**.  
✅ Saves time, improves security, and enforces best practices.

👉 Example: Instead of writing full authentication logic, you can use **Spring Security** in Java or **React Router** in React.

## 5️⃣ Frontend Frameworks

**Frontend frameworks** help make websites look good and work smoothly.
They handle things like page layouts, buttons, navigation, and dynamic updates.

Popular ones:

**React.js** → Used by Facebook, Netflix.

**Angular** → Developed by Google.

**Vue.js** → Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

👉 They make building modern, fast, and interactive websites much easier.
